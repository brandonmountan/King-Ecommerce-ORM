# King-Ecommerce_ORM

## Description

The motivation behind building this project was to gain a better understanding of the ORM (object relational mapping). I wanted to establish a folder/project that could be referenced in the future that encompasses many different aspects of the ORM. This application is heavy on the back end and allows the user to view, create, modify, and delete items from tables in a database. I learned specifically about writing routes and testing those routes in insomnia.
